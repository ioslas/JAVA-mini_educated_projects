# Main Repository
## Introduction
This is the main/master repository which contains various small-educational projects/codes (created or imported from desktop)
for improving portfolios or practice in **Java** language.

## Project Levels
The codes are organized into ("educational") difficulty levels based on **conceptual complexity and learning goals**:
- **junior/beginner**: Basic programs ideal even for new learners or high_school\university students (e.g. HelloWorld, simple input-output) 
- **medium/advanced**: More educational and problem-solving oriented projects, aimed more for self-taught learners who want to improve their programming skills.
- **(pre-)professional/senior**: More complete and structured projects. Suitable for graduated thesis (even in internships) or building portfolios.
