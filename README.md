# Main Repository
## Introduction
This is the main/master repository which contains various small-educational projects/codes (created or imported from desktop)
for portfolios or practice in Java language.

## Project Levels
The codes are organized into (educational\) levels based on **conceptual complexity and learning goals**:
- junior/beginner: Basic programs ideal for new learners or high school students (e.g. HelloWorld, simple input-output) 
- medium/intermediate: codes for junior level jobs or interships
- professional/advanced: codes for senior level jobs/professionals
