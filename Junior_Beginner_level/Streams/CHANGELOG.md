- Added method from converting `int` -> `String` under specific occasions to showcase the dynamic behavior of streams
  
## [2.0] - 04-06-2025
- The initial version was intended to demonstrate basic Stream API usage (e.g., printing, filtering, mapping).
- Additional tasks were added to increase complexity and enhance educational value.
- Some methods and variables from the earlier version were left in comments to preserve the original instructional purpose (e.g., how to create a list with random strings containing only letters).

## [2.1] - 05-06-2025
- Introducing `Optional<Type>` data type in order to clarify value output and avoid displaying the type-wrapped format:<br>
  \- With Optional:
  ```
  The first even number in List is: 16
  ``` 
  \- Without Optional: 
  ```
  The first even number in List is: Optional[16]
  ```
