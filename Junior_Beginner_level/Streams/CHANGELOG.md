## [2.0] - 04-06-2025
- The initial version of this code was to show some basics implimentations of the streams (printing, filtering, mapping, etc.) but I decided to add more tasks in order to make the algorithm more interesting and more high level difficulty
- Some of methods or variables of the previous version are added in comments in order to remain the previous purpose of the algorithm (e.g. How to create a list with random Strings who contains only letter characters) 

## [2.1] - 05-06-2025
