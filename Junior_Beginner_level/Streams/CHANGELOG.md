# Changelog
## [2.0] - 04-06-2025
- The initial version of this code was to show some basics implimentations of the streams (printing, filtering, mapping, etc.) but I decided to add more tasks in order to make the algorithm more interesting and more high level difficulty
- Some of methods or variables of the previous version are added in comments in order to remain the previous purpose of the algorithm (e.g. How to create a list with random Strings who contains only letter characters) 

## [2.1] - 05-06-2025
- We added Optional<Type> variables in order to show the clear value of the list and not the type value:
For example:
```
With the variable: The first even number in List is: 16
Without the variable: The first even number in List is: Optional[16]
```
