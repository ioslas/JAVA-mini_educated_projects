## Module
This module supports and impliments **basic principles and operations** of one of the most *special* data structure (especially in **Linear Algebra**) called **Matrix**. This project is splitted into **3 folders** which contain *one-shot* files' codes. This split is based on the **type of Matrix**:
1. **General (non-square) Matrix**
2. **Square Matrix**
3. **Main/src folder**

Reason: There are methods which general matrices can't do from square matrices

## Features
- The number of **rows, columns** and the **data** are given *randomly*
- The **src** folder contains:
  i) `Matrix.java` class which is the core of this project (There we do all the operations and tasks of matrix)
  ii) 
- There are **2 constructors** of the matrix:
  1. When we know its *rows and columns*
  2. When we know its *data*
- In some comments there are simple, custom matrices (if we want to check if the codes follows matrices' algorithm right) in order to make the results more easy understanding   

## Technologies Used
\- `import java.util.*;` 
  - `Random`: generate random number of rows, columns, data
  - `Scanner`: input from keyboard
  - A `LinkedList` data structure: important for finding Triangular Matrix 

\- **Tables** (which often resembles the matrix): *1d, 2d*
