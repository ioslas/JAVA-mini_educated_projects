# JAVA Graphs Shortest Path
## Module
This module supports the **basic principle and philosophy** of one of the most important data types called as **Graphs** and is implemented into **2 procedures**:
1. **Graph Creation and Printing** which is distinguished into 4 parts or types:

2. Finding the **Shortest Path and Distance** (for the weighted graphs) of 2 graph's vertices known as **start & target**

## Features
- The number of **vertices and edges** are given randomly
- We use an **abstract superclass** and **it's subclasses** which represent the above diagram
- Following the method of the known **graph algorithms** for finding the shortest path between 2 vertices which depends on the **type of graph**:<br>
  | Graph Types        | **Algorithms**                   |
  |------------------  |----------------------------------|
  |Weigthed Graphs     | **DIJKSTRA, Bellman-Ford, ...**  |
  |Unweighted Graphs   | **DFS, AFS, ...**                |
  | ...                | **...**                          |
  | All                | **Floyd-Warshall, ...**          |
